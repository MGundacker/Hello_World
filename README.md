<h1>Get to Know Michael</h1>
<h2>Free Time Activities</h2>
<p>My name is Michael Gundacker and I am a junior at the University of Iowa. At Iowa I study accounting and business analytics and information systems (BAIS). In my free time I enjoy playing cards with my friends and weight training. </p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>I have worked for McCormick Painting Services based out of Cedar Rapids, IA for the past 3 years. At MPS our main projects include staining outdoor wooden structures like decks but we have evolved to offer interior residential and commercial painting services. This has been a really great experience for me because I have gained experience interacting with clients and coordinating team efforts to complete projects.</p>
